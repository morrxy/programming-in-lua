Exercise 10.2: An alternative implementation for the eight-queen problem
would be to generate all possible permutations of 1 to 8 and, for each
permutation, to check whether it is valid. Change the program to use this
approach. How does the performance of the new program compare with the
old one? (Hint: compare the total number of permutations with the number of
times that the original program calls function isplaceok.)
