Exercise12.5: The approach of avoiding constructors when saving tables with
cycles is too radical. It is possible to save the table in a more pleasant
format using constructors for the general case, and to use assignments later
only to fix sharing and loops.

Reimplement function saveï¿¼using this approach. Add to it all the goodies
that you have implemented in the previous exercises (indentation, record syntax,
and list syntax).
